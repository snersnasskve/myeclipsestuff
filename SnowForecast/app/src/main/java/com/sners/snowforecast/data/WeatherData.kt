 * A class to abstract the data from the view
 * This is kind of a controller class despite being called data
 * The word data is here in order to tell callers to come here for data
 *
 * This class has no useful logic; it's just a documentation example.
 *
 * @param T the type of a member in this group.
 * @property name the name of this group.
 * @constructor Creates an empty group.
