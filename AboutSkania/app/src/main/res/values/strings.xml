    <string name="skania_bio_string">Skania was born in June 2016.



  Skania\'s parent was a 3D printer of questionable gender.
    Initially Skania was only able to travel in straight lines, but she quickly learnt to
        manoeuvre backwards and forwards, left and right.
    In 2017 she acquired a sonar for distance sensing. Sadly this only gives a single figure
        between 0 and 50.
    The million dollar question is, assuming someone tells you there is an obstacle 40 in front
        of you, what is the correct course of action.
    Of course there is no answer.\n\n

    So Skania is will always turn right if the number is less than 50 and more than 10.
        When the number goes below 10, she assumes she is turning the wrong way and goes left.
    The consequence of this is that when her battery starts going flat, she starts driving in
        anti-clockwise circles.\n\n

    Skania is very well travelled. She went to South Africa as a babe in bits.
        Few people there had seen 3D printing, so she was able to show off without
        being able to do anything.
    The following year she went to New Zealand.
        There she was able to educate people that robots were not necessarily little dudes
        that walked around the patio saying "meep meep".
    And in 2018 she went to Ivrea in Italy. This was very exciting as Ivrea is the birthplace
        of Arduino and Skania\'s brain is an Arduino Uno.\n\n

    Skania has proved her worth by tootling around the kitchen floor trailing a wet wipe behind her.
        This is a modest beginning to what we hope will be a very useful robot.\n\n
 Good for you Skania.</string>
